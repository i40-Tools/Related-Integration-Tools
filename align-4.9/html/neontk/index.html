<h1>NeOn Alignment plug-in</h1>

<p>The Alignment server and API are available from the NeOn toolkit,
  through a dedicated plug-in: the NeOn Alignment plug-in. This allows
  manipulating alignments from the NeOn toolkit and sharing them
  through the Alignment server.</p>
<p>
The NeOn Alignment plugin panel is obtained by selecting "Windows" ->
"Show view" -> "Others..." -> "Alignment" -> "Alignment".
</p>

<h2>Description of the plug-in</h2>

<p>The NeOn Alignment Plugin allows one to automatically compute and manage ontology alignments. More precisely, the NeOn Alignment Plugin offers the following functionalities:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Find alignments between ontologies or those available on the server</li>
<li>Match ontologies</li>
<li>Trim alignments by applying thresholds to existing alignments</li>
<li>Retrieve and render alignment in a particular format</li>
<li>Store an alignment permanently on the server</li>
</ul>

<p>
The figure below shows the available functions of the plugin.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="Functions.png" class="image" title="Functions.png"><img alt="Functions.png" src="Functions.png" border="0" /></a>
</p>

<p>
These functionalities support the alignment life-cycle which can be described as follows. Alignments are first created through a matching process (which may be manual) or reused from published alignments. Then they may go through an iterative loop of evaluation and enhancement. Again, evaluation can be performed either manually or automatically, it consists of assessing properties of the obtained alignment. Enhancement can be obtained either through manual change of the alignment or application of refinement procedures, e.g., selecting some correspondences by applying thresholds. When an alignment is deemed worth publishing, then it can be stored and communicated to other parties interested in such an alignment. Finally, the alignment is transformed into another form or interpreted for performing actions like mediation or merging.
</p>

<p>
The NeOn Alignment Plugin can work in two modes: offline and
online. The NeOn Alignment plug-in embedds the Alignment API
that is used in the offline mode to accomplish the main functions of
the plug-in. The online mode takes advantage of alignment servers to
offer additionally mechanisms to store and reuse alignments. 
</p>

<h2>Installing the NeOn toolkit and the Alignment plug-in</h2>

<h3>Getting the Neon Toolkit</h3>

<p>A version of the NeonToolkit is available at <a href=http://www.neon-toolkit.org/>http://www.neon-toolkit.org</a>.</p>
<p>From this site, you download a zipped NeonToolkit file according to your Operating System (OS). After unzipping this file, a new directory is created, and within it you have a directory "plug-ins" and an executable file.</p>

<h3>Get the NeOn Alignment plug-in </h3>

<p>
In principle, the Alignment plug-in is avalable directly from the
plug-in import mechanism of the toolkit.
</p>
<p>
However, a version of NeOn Alignment plug-in is available at <a href=http://gforge.inria.fr/projects/alignapi/>http://gforge.inria.fr/projects/alignapi/</a> . From this site you donwload the jar file "neonalign.jar" and put it in the "plug-ins" directory of the NeOnToolkit.</p>

<h3>Run NeonToolkit with the plug-in</h3>

<p>To run NeonToolkit with the NeOn Alignment plug-in, you launch the
  NeOnToolkit with the executable file (e.g. under Linux, you run the
  "NeonToolKit.sh" script). You will see an interface screen like the
  following (under Linux).</p>

</p>

<h2>Using the plugin in local mode (Step-by-step example)</h2>

<p>
In the offline mode, which is activated by clicking on button
"Offline", the NeOn Alignment Plugin can access to NeOn Toolkit
ontologies (i.e. opened ontologies in Ontology Navigator) and match
any pair of them. Resulting alignments can be stored as local system
files and imported to Ontology Navigator as OWL ontologies.
</p>

<a name="Show_the_Ontology_Navigator_view"
   id="Show_the_Ontology_Navigator_view"></a>
<h3 class="mw-headline">Show the Ontology Navigator view</h3>

<p>From the Ontology Navigator, create a
  project, for example "OntologyProject", in this view.</p>

<a name="Open_working_OWL_ontologies"
   id="Open_working_OWL_ontologies"></a>
<h3 class="mw-headline">Open working OWL ontologies</h3>

<p>From the menu bar of the NeonToolkit, open working OWL ontologies
  in the project "OntologyProject" created above by "File -&gt;
  Import... -&gt; Ontologies -&gt; ". You can select either "OWL2
  Ontologies from the filesystem" or "Import ontology from the web"</p>

<!--a name="Activate_the_Neon_Alignment_Plugin"
   id="Activate_the_Neon_Alignment_Plugin"></a>

<h3 class="mw-headline">Activate the Neon Alignment Plugin</h3>

<p>From the menu bar or the button, activate the Neon Alignment Plugin
  and a view for the plug-in will be openned.</p-->

<!--a name="Define_an_alignment_project"
   id="Define_an_alignment_project"></a>
<h3 class="mw-headline">Define an alignment project</h3>

<p>From the view for the plug-in, give a name in the field "Alignment
  Project Name". This name will be used for an Ontology Navigator
  project which includes all alignments created by the NeOn Alignment
  plug-in later on.</p-->

<a name="Matching_two_ontologies" id="Matching_two_ontologies"></a>
<h3 class="mw-headline">Matching two ontologies</h3>

<p>First we must fetch the working ontologies from Ontology Navigator
  by clicking on the button "Refresh". All the working ontologies will
  be added to two lists "Ontology 1" and "Ontology 2". Choose two
  ontologies to match from the two lists. Next, choose an alignment
  method from the list "Alignment methods". Click on "Match" to match
  these two ontologies with the method chosen. The resulting alignment
  will be  added to the list "Alignments found". See the figure below.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="Matching.png" class="image" title="Matching.png"><img alt="Matching.png" src="Matching.png" border="0" /></a>
</p>

<a name="Importing_an_alignment" id="Importing_an_alignment"></a>
<h3 class="mw-headline">Importing an alignment</h3>

<p>Choose an alignment from the list "Alignments found" and click on
  "Import to Ontology Navigator". The alignment chosen will be
  imported as an OWL ontology to the alignment project which was
  created in Ontology Navigator. Users can navigate the OWL alignment
  imported in Ontology Navigator. See the figure below.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="ImporOWLAlign.png" class="image" title="ImporOWLAlign.png"><img alt="ImporOWLAlign.png" src="ImporOWLAlign.png" border="0" /></a>
</p><p><br />
</p>

<h2>Using the plugin with the Alignment Server (step-by-step example)</h2>

<p>
In the online mode,  which is activated by clicking on button
"Online", the NeOn Alignment Plugin provides all functions from the
Alignment Server.  Resulting alignments are stored  on the server and
exported to Ontology Navigator as OWL ontologies. This allows NeOn
Toolkit users, with help of the Ontology Editor, to use, share or edit
alignments.
</p>

<a name="Activate_the_on-line_mode"
   id="Activate_the_on-line_mode"></a>
<h3 class="mw-headline">Activate the on-line mode</h3>

<p>From the view for the plugin, activate the on-line mode by clicking on the button "Online" and the button "Connect" becomes enabled.
<p>

<a name="Connecting" id="Connecting"></a>
<h3 class="mw-headline">Connecting</h3>

<p>To connect to the INRIA's Alignment Server from the NeOn Alignment Plugin, you have to type "aserv.inrialpes.fr" for hostname and "80" for port.<br />
If the connection is successful, we can see the buttons "Refresh", "Match", "Import to Ontology Navigator", "Trim", "Find an alignment...", "Store an alignment..." and "Fetch available alignments..." become enable. In particular, a list of available alignment methods is visible at "Alignment methods". In addition, an Ontology Navigator project, whose name was defined above, is automatically created for alignments.
</p>

<a name="Fetch_available_alignments"
   id="Fetch_available_alignments"></a>
<h3 class="mw-headline">Fetch available alignments</h3>

<p>This function allows users to obtain a list of all alignments
  available on the Alignment Server. See the figure below.</p>

ontology available in the toolkit.
</p>
<h3>Match</h3>
<p>
Match the ontologies selected in the ontology choosers with the method
selected in the method chooser (a new alignment is created and is
available in the chooser of server alignments or local alignments
depending of the mode).
</p>
<h3>Trim (online)</h3>
<p>
