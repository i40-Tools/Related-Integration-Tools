<h1>Changes in version 4.0</h1>

<p>
If your version if anterior to 3.1, please have a look at the <a href="up30to31.html">previous
upgrade instructions</a>.
</p>

<p>
Version 4.0 is a major release of the Alignment API. It has undercome
many changes. However, these changes do affect the implementation of
the API and not its interface. For a more precise list of all changes,
please have a look at the <a href="relnotes.html">release notes</a>.
</p>

<h2>Use java.util.Properties instead of Parameters</h2>

<p>The change that should be the most frequent is that the Alignment
  API interfaces are expressed in terms
  of <tt>java.util.Properties</tt> instead of
  the <tt>org.semanticweb.owl.align.Parameters</tt>. Hence, most of
  the references to <tt>Parameters</tt> can be changed
  into <tt>Properties</tt> (and <tt>set/getParameter</tt>
  into <tt>set/getProperty</tt>). The <tt>org.semanticweb.owl.align.Parameters</tt>
  is morally deprecated and should be avoided.
</p>
<p>
We have evolved the <tt>BasicParameters</tt> implementation so that it
extends <tt>Properties</tt>. Hence, if you use
the <tt>BasicParameters</tt> interface, you can still use it.
</p>

<h2>Replacement of OMWG by EDOAL</h2>

<p>
The 2OMWG level alignments, provided by the mappingapi, have been
discontinued and replaced by the integrated <a href="edoal.html">EDOAL
language</a> (identified as the 2EDOAL level).
If you have previously used the 2OMWG level language and need to
migrate, please, contact us and we will do our best to help you.
</p>
