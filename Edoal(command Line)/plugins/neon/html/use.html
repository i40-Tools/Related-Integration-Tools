<h1 class="mw-headline">NeOn Alignment Plugin: Use cases</h1>

<p>
The NeOn Alignment plug-in is used for finding alignments for jointly
using two ontologies under the Neon Toolkit and contextualizing an
ontology with respect to another one.
</p>
<p>
The OntoConto plug-in uses it for visualising ontologies and alignments.
</p>
<p>
In addition, the plug-in is a basic tool for finding and manipulating
alignments between  pharmaceutical ontologies in WP8. This work has
been presented in Deliverable D3.4.1.
