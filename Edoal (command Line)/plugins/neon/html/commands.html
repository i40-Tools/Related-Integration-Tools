<h1 class="mw-headline">NeOn Alignment Plugin: Commands</h1>

<p>
The NeOn Alignment plugin panel is obtained by selecting "Windows" ->
"Show view" -> "Others..." -> "Alignment" -> "Alignment".
</p>
<p>
The commands which can be activated through the interface are as
follows:
</p>

<h3>Online</h3>
<p>
Switch to the online mode in which the plug-in is connected to an
Alignment server and can take advantage of its stored alignements and
available matching methods. Only ontologies accessible on the web can be
matched in this mode.
</p>
<h3>Offline</h3>
<p>
Switch to the offline mode in which local ontologies are matched with
the matching methods available within the NeOn toolkit.
</p>
<h3>Refresh</h3>
<p>
Update the two ontology choosers (Ontology 1 and Ontology 2) with the
ontology available in the toolkit.
</p>
<h3>Match</h3>
<p>
Match the ontologies selected in the ontology choosers with the method
selected in the method chooser (a new alignment is created and is
available in the chooser of server alignments or local alignments
depending of the mode).
</p>
<h3>Trim (online)</h3>
<p>
Trims the correspondences in the alignment selected in the server
alignment chooser whose confidence is below some threshold (a new
alignment is created).
</p>
<h3>Import (online)</h3>
<p>
The alignment selected in the server alignment chooser is imported as
an ontology in the NeOn toolkit.
</p>
<h3>Store (online)</h3>
<p>
Stores the alignment selected in the server alignment chooser on
the server (it will be kept in the database and will survive any
server shutdown).
</p>
<h3>Import (offline)</h3>
<p>
The alignment selected in the local alignment chooser is imported as
an ontology in the NeOn toolkit.
</p>
<h3>Trim (offline)</h3>
<p>
Trims the correspondences in the alignment selected in the local
alignment chooser whose confidence is below some threshold (a new
alignment is created).
</p>
<h3>Upload (online)</h3>
<p>
Uploads the alignment selected in the local alignment chooser on
the server.
</p>
<h3>Find alignments for ontologies (online)</h3>
<p>
Fills the server alignment chooser with all alignments available on
the server.
</p>
<h3>Find all alignments from server (online)</h3>
<p>
Fills the server alignment chooser with all alignments between the two
ontologies of the ontology choosers (Ontology 1 and Ontology 2)
available on the server.
