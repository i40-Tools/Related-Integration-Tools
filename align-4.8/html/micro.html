<h1  class="titre">Alignment API: lightweight versions</h1>

<p>
Because we want the Alignment API to be used in resource-limited
environments, we experiment with offering minimal versions.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>plugins/android</tt> folder contains necessary tools for generating
stripped down versions of the Alignment API so that they can be embedded in a small
platform (the target being the Android platform for
our <a href="http://swip.inrialpes.fr">own purposes</a>).
</p>

<h2>Microalign</h2>

<p>
So far, we only offer a client version of the API implementation
which should be suitable for any program which simply wants to
retrieve and manipulate alignments. This version does not embark any matcher,
evaluator, <span color="red">test generator</span>, server, or command
line interfaces. So if you have implemented a matcher, it should work
simply with this version. Microalign can still act as a client for the
Alignment server and retrieve alignments from the server.
</p>

<h3>What is included/excluded</h3>

<pre>
+ org.semanticweb.owl.align                  (API)
+ fr.inrialpes.exmo
+                  .ontowrap                 (Ontology API wrappers)
-                           .*               (All implementations)
+                  .align                    (Implementation)
-                        .cli                (Command line interface)
+                        .util               (Utility classes)
-                        .gen                (Test generator)
-                        .service            (Alignement server)
+                        .impl               (Basic implementation)
-                             .eval          (Evaluators)
-                             .matchers      (Matchers)
+                        .parser             (Parsers)
</pre>
<p>
Only the libraries related to Jena are needed:
Jena (+ icu4j and iri), log4j, xerces (+resolver) and xsdlib (+relaxngDatatype).
</p>

<h3>Further stripping</h3>

<p>
We are currently experimenting with <a href="http://proguard.sourceforge.net/">ProGuard</a> in order
to strip down the code further. The results are displayed with the "*"
prefix in the table below.
</p>

<h3>How to generate</h3>

<p>
It is necessary to go in the plugin/android directory and use the ant file.
<div class="terminal">
$ ant compileall              ==> compile the strict necessary
$ ant jar                     ==> generate the microalign.jar library
$ ant zip                     ==> gerenate the malign.zip file with necessary jars
$ ant testindep               ==> recompile the sources in isolation for testing independence
$ ant clean                   ==> restore the initial state of this directory
$ ant shrink                  ==> uses proguard to shrink the Jar file (experimental)
</div>
</p>

<h3>How to use</h3>

<p>Move the content of the <tt>microalign.zip</tt> file in the lib(s) directory of your Android project.
</p>

<p>The <tt>microalign.jar</tt> may be used alone if a version of Jena is already embedded.</p>


<h2>Other profiles</h2>

<p>
Of course, you can define other profiles by modifying the build.xml file.
</p>
<p>
We are considering, introducing a pair of other profiles:
<dl>
<dt>align</dt><dd>the API itself, without any implementation, is already a minimal
version of the API which requires no additional libraries;</dd>
<dt>picoalign</dt><dd>an even smaller package without jena and edoal;</dd>
<dt>microalign</dt><dd>The procalign.jar generated here is called microalign.jar and contains
around 30k of ontowrap.jar.</dd>
<dt>aservlite</dt><dd>a minimal Alignment server version.</dd>
</dl>
</p>
<!--p>
One can further imagine dropping more from the API, i.e., suppressing
the alignment RDFParser (which requires Jena) and the whole Jena. This would lead
to the inability to parse EDOAL, so it could be suppressed as well. We
call the bare minimal version picoalign. However, some rendering
classes make reference to EDOAL and the AligmnentParser itself refers
to the RDFParser. Hence, producing picoalign would require
reengineering the code further.
</p-->
<p>
The resulting sizes to be embedded are the following:
<center>
<table border="1">
<th><td>standard</td><td>micro</td><td>micro*</td><td>pico</td><td>align</td></th>
<tr><td>align.jar</td><td>16k</td><td>16k</td><td>16k</td><td>16k</td><td>16k</td></tr>
<tr><td>ontowrap.jar</td><td>61k</td><td>-</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>procalign.jar</td><td>238k</td><td>154k</td><td>99k</td><td>152k</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>alignsvc.jar</td><td>98k</td><td>-</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>lib</td><td>29232k</td><td>7444k</td><td>7444k</td><td>2272k</td><td></td></tr>
</table>
</center>
</p>
<p>
It is clear that the only interest of
picoalign comes from dropping Jena. One can also use <a href="http://code.google.com/p/androjena/">androjena</a>
which amounts to 5332k (version 0.5 12/2010; all Jena libs involved).
<a href="http://poseidon.ws.dei.polimi.it/ca/?page_id=59">&mu;jena</a> is a rewritting of Jena for MIDP-2.0/CLDC-1.1
mobile phones (but some have managed to use it under Android). It has
been developed in 2007, but the 1.5 version dates back to 2010.
It only weights 393k but can only parse ntriples. The authors have
been able to demonstrate its use in running an ontology matcher (XSom)
on a phone!
