				Human interaction should be a part of the WebLab
				platform. Some particular tasks such as relevance
				feedback will need a clear data model in order to
				exchange information about user needs, behaviours,
				preferences, profile... and so on. Thus this particular
				object will handle them in a standardised way to offer
				the human resource to all the services which needs them.
				The internal format used to represent information about
				a human are not fixed since it depends on other
				component needs, but it must be serialised in XML. The
				project could at least benefit from recent initiatives
				around format and methodology to handle user's
				information (P3P, UUCM, APML...).

				Some major privacy issues are raised when dealing with
				user's information and this must be taken into account.
				However it is not in this document scope.

				As a resource, a human resource could be annotated to
				provide, for example, meta-information on its
				application domain.
