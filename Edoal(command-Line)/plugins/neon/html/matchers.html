<h1 class="mw-headline">NeOn Alignment Plugin: Standard matchers</h1>

<p>
The Alignment plug-in comes with the built-in matchers of the
Alignment API not requiring extra installations (like WordNet).
We give below a simple description of their behaviour.
</p>

<h3>fr.inrialpes.exmo.align.impl.method.SubsDistNameAlignment</h3>
<p>
Establishes an alignment based on the comparison of the names of
entities in the two ontologies to match. The measure will depend on
the ration of the length of the longest common substring of both names
over the minimum lenght of these names.
</p>

<h3>fr.inrialpes.exmo.align.impl.method.ClassStructAlignment</h3>
<p>
Establishes an alignment based on the comparison of the properties
that classes have in common. These properties are themselves compared
based on correspondences provided by an initial alignment.
</p>

<h3>fr.inrialpes.exmo.align.impl.method.NameEqAlignment</h3>
<p>
Establishes an alignment based on the comparison of the names of
entities in the two ontologies to match. The measure will be "1." if
both names are equal (after downcasing), and "0." if they are not.
</p>

<h3>fr.inrialpes.exmo.align.impl.method.StringDistAlignment</h3>
<p>
Establishes an alignment based on the comparison of the names of
entities in the two ontologies to match. In this case, the measure
computes exactly <tt>NameEqAlignment</tt> (this is a parametric
measures and the parameters are not available in the toolkit).
</p>

<h3>fr.inrialpes.exmo.align.impl.method.NameAndPropertyAlignment</h3>
<p>
Establishes an alignment based on the comparison of the properties
that classes have in common. These properties are themselves compared
based on correspondences between their names based on sub-string
distance (like in <tt>SubsDistNameAlignment</tt>).
</p>

<h3>fr.inrialpes.exmo.align.impl.method.StructSubsDistAlignment</h3>
<p>
Establishes, like <tt>StructSubsDistAlignment</tt>, an alignment based
on the comparison of the properties that classes have in common,
except that, in the present case, an optimal matching is computed
between the properties first.
</p>

<h3>fr.inrialpes.exmo.align.impl.method.SMAONameAlignment</h3>
<p>
Establishes an alignment based on the comparison of the names of
entities in the two ontologies to match. It is somewhat similar to
the <tt>EditDistNameAlignment</tt> but uses specific normalisation
strategies based on how computer scientists usually name things (it
knows about the Camel's notation, use of underscore, etc.).
</p>

<h3>fr.inrialpes.exmo.align.impl.method.EditDistNameAlignment</h3>
<p>
Establishes an alignment based on the comparison of the names of
entities in the two ontologies to match. The measure is based on the
edit distance between the names of the entity to compare. It measures
the cost of transforming one string into another through insertion,
deletion and replacement of characters.
