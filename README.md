# Related-Integration-Tools
This repo contains existing integration tools for I4.0 standards.
The existing frameworks are developed using java to adapt to I4.0 standard documents.
Currently they support AutomationML documents.

## This repo contains the following frameworks :
## The Alignment API 
Alignment API is an API and implementation for expressing and sharing ontology alignments.
Using ontologies is the priviledged way to achieve interoperability among heterogeneous systems within the Semantic web. However, as the ontologies underlying two systems are not necessarily compatible, they may in turn need to be reconcilied. Ontology reconciliation requires most of the time to find the correspondences between entities (e.g., classes, objects, properties) occuring in the ontologies. We call a set of such correspondences an alignment. We have designed a format for expressing alignments in a uniform way. The goal of this format is to be able to share on the web the available alignments. The format is expressed in RDF, so it is freely extensible.

## SILK 
Silk is an open source framework for integrating heterogeneous data sources. The primary uses cases of Silk include:

* Generating links between related data items within different Linked Data sources.
* Linked Data publishers can use Silk to set RDF links from their data sources to other data sources on the Web.
* Applying data transformations to structured data sources.
